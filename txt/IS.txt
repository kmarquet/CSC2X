===Title
Intelligent Systems

===Intro
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the study of solutions for problems that are difficult or impractical
to solve with traditional methods. It is used pervasively in support of everyday applications such
as email, word-processing and search, as well as in the design and analysis of autonomous agents
that perceive their environment and interact rationally with the environment.
The solutions rely on a broad set of general and specialized knowledge representation schemes,
problem solving mechanisms and learning techniques. They deal with sensing (e.g., speech
recognition, natural language understanding, computer vision), problem-solving (e.g., search,
planning), and acting (e.g., robotics) and the architectures needed to support them (e.g., agents,
multi-agents). The study of Artificial Intelligence prepares the student to determine when an AI
approach is appropriate for a given problem, identify the appropriate representation and
reasoning mechanism, and implement and evaluate it.
