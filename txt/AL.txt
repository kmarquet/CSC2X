===Title
Algorithms and Complexity

===Intro

Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software engineering. The real-world
performance of any software system depends on: (1) the algorithms chosen and (2) the suitability
and efficiency of the various layers of implementation. Good algorithm design is therefore
crucial for the performance of all software systems. Moreover, the study of algorithms provides
insight into the intrinsic nature of the problem as well as possible solution techniques
independent of programming language, programming paradigm, computer hardware, or any
other implementation aspect.
An important part of computing is the ability to select algorithms appropriate to particular
purposes and to apply them, recognizing the possibility that no suitable algorithm may exist. This
facility relies on understanding the range of algorithms that address an important set of well-
defined problems, recognizing their strengths and weaknesses, and their suitability in particular
contexts. Efficiency is a pervasive theme throughout this area.
This knowledge area defines the central concepts and skills required to design, implement, and
analyze algorithms for solving problems. Algorithms are essential in all advanced areas of
computer science: artificial intelligence, databases, distributed computing, graphics, networking,
operating systems, programming languages, security, and so on. Algorithms that have specific
utility in each of these are listed in the relevant knowledge areas. Cryptography, for example,
appears in the new Knowledge Area on Information Assurance and Security (IAS), while parallel
and distributed algorithms appear the Knowledge Area in Parallel and Distributed Computing
(PD).
As with all knowledge areas, the order of topics and their groupings do not necessarily correlate
to a specific order of presentation. Different programs will teach the topics in different courses
and should do so in the order they believe is most appropriate for their students.
