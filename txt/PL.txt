===Title
Programming Languages

===Intro
Programming languages are the medium through which programmers precisely describe
concepts, formulate algorithms, and reason about solutions. In the course of a career, a computer
scientist will work with many different languages, separately or together. Software developers
must understand the programming models underlying different languages and make informed
design choices in languages supporting multiple complementary approaches. Computer
scientists will often need to learn new languages and programming constructs, and must
understand the principles underlying how programming language features are defined,
composed, and implemented. The effective use of programming languages, and appreciation of
their limitations, also requires a basic knowledge of programming language translation and static
program analysis, as well as run-time components such as memory management.

=====Object-Oriented Programming
==Intro
==Topics
Object-oriented design
o Decomposition into objects carrying state and having behavior
o Class-hierarchy design for modeling
Definition of classes: fields, methods, and constructors
Subclasses, inheritance, and method overriding
Dynamic dispatch: definition of method-call
Subtyping (cross-reference {PL/Type Systems})
o Subtype polymorphism; implicit upcasts in typed languages
o Notion of behavioral replacement: subtypes acting like supertypes
o Relationship between subtyping and inheritance
Object-oriented idioms for encapsulation
o Privacy and visibility of class members
o Interfaces revealing only method signatures
o Abstract base classes
Using collection classes, iterators, and other common library components

==Skills
Design and implement a class. [Usage]
Use subclassing to design simple class hierarchies that allow code to be reused for distinct subclasses.
[Usage]
Correctly reason about control flow in a program using dynamic dispatch. [Usage]
Compare and contrast (1) the procedural/functional approach (defining a function for each operation with
the function body providing a case for each data variant) and (2) the object-oriented approach (defining a
class for each data variant with the class definition providing a method for each operation). Understand
both as defining a matrix of operations and variants. [Assessment]
Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping
(the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype). [Familiarity]
Use object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members. [Usage]
Define and use iterators and other operations on aggregates, including operations that take functions as
arguments, in multiple programming languages, selecting the most natural idioms for each language.
[Usage]

=====Functional Programming
==Intro
==Topics
Effect-free programming
o Function calls have no side effects, facilitating compositional reasoning
o Variables are immutable, preventing unexpected changes to program data by other code
o Data can be freely aliased or copied without introducing unintended effects from mutation
Processing structured data (e.g., trees) via functions with cases for each data variant
o Associated language constructs such as discriminated unions and pattern-matching over them
o Functions defined over compound data in terms of functions applied to the constituent pieces
First-class functions (taking, returning, and storing functions)
Function closures (functions using variables in the enclosing lexical environment)
o Basic meaning and definition -- creating closures at run-time by capturing the environment
o Canonical idioms: call-backs, arguments to iterators, reusable code via function arguments
o Using a closure to encapsulate data in its environment
o Currying and partial application
Defining higher-order operations on aggregates, especially map, reduce/fold, and filter

==Skills
Write basic algorithms that avoid assigning to mutable state or considering reference equality. [Usage]
Write useful functions that take and return other functions. [Usage]
Compare and contrast (1) the procedural/functional approach (defining a function for each operation with the function body providing a case for each data variant) and (2) the object-oriented approach (defining a class for each data variant with the class definition providing a method for each operation). Understand both as defining a matrix of operations and variants. [Assessment]
Correctly reason about variables and lexical scope in a program using function closures. [Usage]
Use functional encapsulation mechanisms such as closures and modular interfaces. [Usage]

arguments, in multiple programming languages, selecting the most natural idioms for each language.

o Use for generic libraries such as collections
o Comparison with ad hoc polymorphism (overloading) and subtype polymorphism
Complementary benefits of static and dynamic typing
o Errors early vs. errors late/avoided

while prototyping and conveniently allow flexible coding patterns such as heterogeneous
collections
