===Title
Parallel and Distributed Computing

===Intro
The past decade has brought explosive growth in multiprocessor computing, including multi-core
processors and distributed data centers. As a result, parallel and distributed computing has
moved from a largely elective topic to become more of a core component of undergraduate
computing curricula. Both parallel and distributed computing entail the logically simultaneous
execution of multiple processes, whose operations have the potential to interleave in complex
ways. Parallel and distributed computing builds on foundations in many areas, including an
understanding of fundamental systems concepts such as concurrency and parallel execution,
consistency in state/memory manipulation, and latency. Communication and coordination
among processes is rooted in the message-passing and shared-memory models of computing and
such algorithmic concepts as atomicity, consensus, and conditional waiting. Achieving speedup
in practice requires an understanding of parallel algorithms, strategies for problem
decomposition, system architecture, detailed implementation strategies, and performance
analysis and tuning. Distributed systems highlight the problems of security and fault tolerance,
emphasize the maintenance of replicated state, and introduce additional issues that bridge to
computer networking.
Because parallelism interacts with so many areas of computing, including at least algorithms,
languages, systems, networking, and hardware, many curricula will put different parts of the
knowledge area in different courses, rather than in a dedicated course. While we acknowledge
that computer science is moving in this direction and may reach that point, in 2013 this process is
still in flux and we feel it provides more useful guidance to curriculum designers to aggregate the
fundamental parallelism topics in one place. Note, however, that the fundamentals of
concurrency and mutual exclusion appear in the Systems Fundamentals (SF) Knowledge Area.
Many curricula may choose to introduce parallelism and concurrency in the same course (see
below for the distinction intended by these terms). Further, we note that the topics and learning
outcomes listed below include only brief mentions of purely elective coverage. At the present
time, there is too much diversity in topics that share little in common (including for example,
parallel scientific computing, process calculi, and non-blocking data structures) to recommend
particular topics be covered in elective courses.

Because the terminology of parallel and distributed computing varies among communities, we
provide here brief descriptions of the intended senses of a few terms. This list is not exhaustive
or definitive, but is provided for the sake of clarity.
• Parallelism: Using additional computational resources simultaneously, usually for
speedup.
• Concurrency: Efficiently and correctly managing concurrent access to resources.
• Activity: A computation that may proceed concurrently with others; for example a
program, process, thread, or active parallel hardware component.
• Atomicity: Rules and properties governing whether an action is observationally
indivisible; for example, setting all of the bits in a word, transmitting a single packet, or
completing a transaction.
• Consensus: Agreement among two or more activities about a given predicate; for
example, the value of a counter, the owner of a lock, or the termination of a thread.
• Consistency: Rules and properties governing agreement about the values of variables
written, or messages produced, by some activities and used by others (thus possibly
exhibiting a data race); for example, sequential consistency, stating that the values of all
variables in a shared memory parallel program are equivalent to that of a single program
performing some interleaving of the memory accesses of these activities.
• Multicast: A message sent to possibly many recipients, generally without any constraints
about whether some recipients receive the message before others. An event is a multicast
message sent to a designated set of listeners or subscribers.
As multi-processor computing continues to grow in the coming years, so too will the role of
parallel and distributed computing in undergraduate computing curricula. In addition to the
guidelines presented here, we also direct the interested reader to the document entitled
"NSF/TCPP Curriculum Initiative on Parallel and Distributed Computing - Core Topics for
Undergraduates", available from the website: http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~tcpp/curriculum/.
General cross-referencing note: Systems Fundamentals also contains an introduction to
parallelism (SF/Computational Paradigms, SF/System Support for Parallelism, SF/Performance).

The introduction to parallelism in SF complements the one here and there is no ordering
constraint between them. In SF, the idea is to provide a unified view of the system support for
simultaneous execution at multiple levels of abstraction (parallelism is inherent in gates,
processors, operating systems, and servers), whereas here the focus is on a preliminary
understanding of parallelism as a computing primitive and the complications that arise in parallel
and concurrent programming. Given these different perspectives, the hours assigned to each are
not redundant: the layered systems view and the high-level computing concepts are accounted
for separately in terms of the core hours.
