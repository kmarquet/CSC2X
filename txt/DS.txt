===Title
Discrete Structures

===Intro

Discrete structures are foundational material for computer science. By foundational we mean that
relatively few computer scientists will be working primarily on discrete structures, but that many
other areas of computer science require the ability to work with concepts from discrete
structures. Discrete structures include important material from such areas as set theory, logic,
graph theory, and probability theory.
The material in discrete structures is pervasive in the areas of data structures and algorithms but
appears elsewhere in computer science as well. For example, an ability to create and understand
a proof—either a formal symbolic proof or a less formal but still mathematically rigorous
argument—is important in virtually every area of computer science, including (to name just a
few) formal specification, verification, databases, and cryptography. Graph theory concepts are
used in networks, operating systems, and compilers. Set theory concepts are used in software
engineering and in databases. Probability theory is used in intelligent systems, networking, and a
number of computing applications.
Given that discrete structures serves as a foundation for many other areas in computing, it is
worth noting that the boundary between discrete structures and other areas, particularly
Algorithms and Complexity, Software Development Fundamentals, Programming Languages,
and Intelligent Systems, may not always be crisp. Indeed, different institutions may choose to
organize the courses in which they cover this material in very different ways. Some institutions
may cover these topics in one or two focused courses with titles like "discrete structures" or
"discrete mathematics," whereas others may integrate these topics in courses on programming,
algorithms, and/or artificial intelligence. Combinations of these approaches are also prevalent
(e.g., covering many of these topics in a single focused introductory course and covering the
remaining topics in more advanced topical courses).
