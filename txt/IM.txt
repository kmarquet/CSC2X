===Title
Information Management

===Intro
Information Management is primarily concerned with the capture, digitization, representation,
organization, transformation, and presentation of information; algorithms for efficient and
effective access and updating of stored information; data modeling and abstraction; and physical
file storage techniques. The student needs to be able to develop conceptual and physical data
models, determine which IM methods and techniques are appropriate for a given problem, and be
able to select and implement an appropriate IM solution that addresses relevant design concerns
including scalability, accessibility and usability.
We also note that IM is related to fundamental information security concepts that are described
in the Information Assurance and Security (IAS) topic area, IAS/Fundamental Concepts.
