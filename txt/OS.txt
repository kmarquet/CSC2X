===Title
Operating Systems

===Intro
An operating system defines an abstraction of hardware and manages resource sharing among
the computerâ€™s users. The topics in this area explain the most basic knowledge of operating
systems in the sense of interfacing an operating system to networks, teaching the difference
between the kernel and user modes, and developing key approaches to operating system design
and implementation. This knowledge area is structured to be complementary to the Systems
Fundamentals (SF), Networking and Communication (NC), Information Assurance and Security
(IAS), and the Parallel and Distributed Computing (PD) knowledge areas. The Systems
Fundamentals and Information Assurance and Security knowledge areas are the new ones to
include contemporary issues. For example, Systems Fundamentals includes topics such as
performance, virtualization and isolation, and resource allocation and scheduling; Parallel and
Distributed Systems includes parallelism fundamentals; and and Information Assurance and
Security includes forensics and security issues in depth. Many courses in Operating Systems
will draw material from across these knowledge areas.
