===Title
Computational Science

===Intro
Computational Science is a field of applied computer science, that is, the application of computer
science to solve problems across a range of disciplines. In the book Introduction to
Computational Science [3], the authors offer the following definition: “the field of computational
science combines computer simulation, scientific visualization, mathematical modeling,
computer programming and data structures, networking, database design, symbolic computation,
and high performance computing with various disciplines.” Computer science, which largely
focuses on the theory, design, and implementation of algorithms for manipulating data and
information, can trace its roots to the earliest devices used to assist people in computation over
four thousand years ago. Various systems were created and used to calculate astronomical
positions. Ada Lovelace’s programming achievement was intended to calculate Bernoulli
numbers. In the late nineteenth century, mechanical calculators became available, and were
immediately put to use by scientists. The needs of scientists and engineers for computation have
long driven research and innovation in computing. As computers increase in their problem-
solving power, computational science has grown in both breadth and importance. It is a
discipline in its own right [2] and is considered to be “one of the five college majors on the rise
[1].” An amazing assortment of sub-fields have arisen under the umbrella of Computational
Science, including computational biology, computational chemistry, computational mechanics,
computational archeology, computational finance, computational sociology and computational
forensics.
Some fundamental concepts of computational science are germane to every computer scientist
(e.g., modeling and simulation), and computational science topics are extremely valuable
components of an undergraduate program in computer science. This area offers exposure to
many valuable ideas and techniques, including precision of numerical representation, error
analysis, numerical techniques, parallel architectures and algorithms, modeling and simulation,
information visualization, software engineering, and optimization. Topics relevant to
computational science include fundamental concepts in program construction (SDF/Fundamental
Programming Concepts), algorithm design (SDF/Algorithms and Design), program testing
(SDF/Development Methods), data representations (AR/Machine Representation of Data), and
basic computer architecture (AR/Memory System Organization and Architecture). At the sametime, students who take courses in this area have an opportunity to apply these techniques in a
wide range of application areas, such as molecular and fluid dynamics, celestial mechanics,
economics, biology, geology, medicine, and social network analysis. Many of the techniques
used in these areas require advanced mathematics such as calculus, differential equations, and
linear algebra. The descriptions here assume that students have acquired the needed
mathematical background elsewhere.
In the computational science community, the terms run, modify, and create are often used to
describe levels of understanding. This chapter follows the conventions of other chapters in this
volume and uses the terms familiarity, usage, and assessment.

=====Introduction to Modeling and Simulation
==Intro
Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science. A principal approach to computing is
to abstract the real world, create a model that can be simulated on a machine. The roots of
computer science can be traced to this approach, modeling things such as trajectories of artillery
shells and the modeling cryptographic protocols, both of which pushed the development of early
computing systems in the early and mid-1940’s.
Modeling and simulation of real world systems represent essential knowledge for computer
scientists and provide a foundation for computational sciences. Any introduction to modeling
and simulation would either include or presume an introduction to computing. In addition, a
general set of modeling and simulation techniques, data visualization methods, and software
testing and evaluation mechanisms are also important.
